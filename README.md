# ServerPing
Ping 2 servers. If one is down, an email will be sent to an email of your choice. This code is aimed towards gmail. You must allow scripts in your gmail security settings in order for the script to log in and send the email. 


This script is designed to repeat every 300 seconds. This means that if a server is down. You will get an email every 5 minutes. In order to change this, remove "test()" on line 43.
