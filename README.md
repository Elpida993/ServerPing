# ServerPing
Ping 2 servers. If one is down, an email will be sent to an email of your choice. In order to send the email you need a email address that the script can log into. This script is coded for gmail but the reciever of the email can be anything you want. You must allow scripts in your gmail security settings in order for the script to log in and send the email. 


This script is designed to repeat every 300 seconds. This means that if a server is down. You will get an email every 5 minutes. In order to change this, remove "test()" on line 43.
